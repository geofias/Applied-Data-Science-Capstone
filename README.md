# SpaceX Rocket Pedictions

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its
website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers
cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

This Project makes predictions about the landing of the first stage
and with this we can determine the cost of a launch.
This information can be used if an alternate
company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch
